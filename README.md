## Project Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
My Project here is centred around the name of the website which is Arc Bionics. It's mainly designed and catered to
amputees who are suffering with a possibility of having no replacement or options for another arm or a leg, thus making 
it easiy accessible for them to invest in a bionic limb that functions the same as an human limb.

I wanted this project/website to be special as this is something i do take in a passionate manner as I have a relative who
has a similar situation and does not have any access to a bionic arm, so this was the main inspiration behind this website of mine.

I had taken quite a substantial amount of time as to how i could bring a design like this into action and turn it into a website.
In the UX section below you will be able to see this.

## Design Choices

- ### Font Selection 

    - I had chosen a universal font to be used across the whole of the website as this made styling easy and had fit in well with the theme of my website.
      The Font I had chosen was [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans?query=noto+sa)

- ### Colour Choice 

    - When considering the colour theme of my website in the pre planning phase, I had to choose a theme that combined colours effortlessly
      and ensure that there would be no confusion so the user does not get distracted by the colours used. 

      The Images and text colour had contrasted the theme of the logo and website well, so I had chosen a mix of colours which include; Black, White, Grey and 
      a shade of yellow as seen below.

- ### Logo Creation

    - When Creating the Logo in the pre planning phase, I had to make sure If i wanted the logo present at the header of the website or just the text to be 
      made as responsive. Upon further thinking, I had then decided to add the logo within the site itself so it was embedded.
      
    - I wanted the Logo to have a futuristic touch to it as bionics is something of the future and enables the user to think bionics are the future 
      and will be quickly in development as it will under go trials to be used in the NHS.
    
    - The Logo was created entirely by my own design as well as the image by using the online resource called [Logo Makr](https://logomakr.com)

## Wireframes

- ### *Disclaimer: Wireframes were made pre website production but had been added to documention in github after the completion of website*

    - I had created the wireframes as a draft and How I wanted the layout to be in the final website.
      Upon comparing the wireframes and the final design, there are subtle changes in terms of element placement etc.
    
    - My Wireframes focus on the basic layout structure of the website and then identifying how it would look across multiple devices.
 

    - The Wireframes that I had developed were in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

    - Wireframes for the website including mobile layout can be found [Here](documentation/wireframes/MS1-Wireframes-Mockup.pdf)
