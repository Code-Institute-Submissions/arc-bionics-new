## Project Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
My Project here is centred around the name of the website which is Arc Bionics. It's mainly designed and catered to
amputees who are suffering with a possibility of having no replacement or options for another arm or a leg, thus making 
it easiy accessible for them to invest in a bionic limb that functions the same as an human limb.

I wanted this project/website to be special as this is something i do take in a passionate manner as I have a relative who
has a similar situation and does not have any access to a bionic arm, so this was the main inspiration behind this website of mine.

I had taken quite a substantial amount of time as to how i could bring a design like this into action and turn it into a website.
In the UX section below you will be able to see this.
