## Project Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
My Project here is centred around the name of the website which is Arc Bionics. It's mainly designed and catered to
amputees who are suffering with a possibility of having no replacement or options for another arm or a leg, thus making 
it easiy accessible for them to invest in a bionic limb that functions the same as an human limb.

I wanted this project/website to be special as this is something i do take in a passionate manner as I have a relative who
has a similar situation and does not have any access to a bionic arm, so this was the main inspiration behind this website of mine.

I had taken quite a substantial amount of time as to how i could bring a design like this into action and turn it into a website.
In the UX section below you will be able to see this.

## Design Choices <a name="designchoices"></a>

- ### Website Drafts
<h2 align="center"><img src="documentation/Website-Drafts.jpg"></h2>

- Originally before the creation of this website, I had multiple ideas as to how i would want my website to be like.

- Above, you can see 2 drafts I had made mid website development but given the span of my website, I had given up on these 2 plans
  as it would make it too complicated for me as a first project and did not want to confuse the user with it.

- The ethos shown across the second draft image was customised in a way where it would sweep across the screen in a smooth manner.

- *Note: These 2 draft website plans were created before this final product and had been kept on the side to take inspiration from*


- ### Font Selection 

    - I had chosen a universal font to be used across the whole of the website as this made styling easy and had fit in well with the theme of my website.
      The Font I had chosen was [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans?query=noto+sa)

- ### Colour Choice 

    - When considering the colour theme of my website in the pre planning phase, I had to choose a theme that combined colours effortlessly
      and ensure that there would be no confusion so the user does not get distracted by the colours used. 

      The Images and text colour had contrasted the theme of the logo and website well, so I had chosen a mix of colours which include; Black, White, Grey and 
      a shade of yellow as seen below.

      <h2 align="center"><img src="/assets/images/Color-Pallete-Site.png"></h2>


- ### Logo Creation

    - When Creating the Logo in the pre planning phase, I had to make sure If i wanted the logo present at the header of the website or just the text to be 
      made as responsive. Upon further thinking, I had then decided to add the logo within the site itself so it was embedded.
      
    - I wanted the Logo to have a futuristic touch to it as bionics is something of the future and enables the user to think bionics are the future 
      and will be quickly in development as it will under go trials to be used in the NHS.
    
    - The Logo was created entirely by my own design as well as the image by using the online resource called [Logo Makr](https://logomakr.com)

    <h2 align="center"><img src="/assets/images/arc-bionics-logo-main.png"></h2>


## Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

- ### *Disclaimer: Wireframes were made pre website production but had been added to documentation in github after the completion of website*

    - I had created the wireframes as a draft and How I wanted the layout to be in the final website.
      Upon comparing the wireframes and the final design, there are subtle changes in terms of element placement etc.
    
    - My Wireframes focus on the basic layout structure of the website and then identifying how it would look across multiple devices.
 

    - The Wireframes that I had developed were in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

    - Wireframes for the website including mobile layout can be found [Here](documentation/wireframes/MS1-Wireframes-Mockup.pdf)


## Features <a name="features"></a>

- Responsive on all device sizes, from handhelds to tablets by using Media Queries.

- Interactive Elements used across the website.

- Captivating hero image with an effect added to grasp user's attention.

- Adaptive Colour Theme used to bring the website together.

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
 - This was used to validate the CSS.

    Results for the validation service can be found [Here](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator$link)

[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
 - This was used to validate the content of my HTML content.

    Results for the HTML validation can be found [Here](documentation/HTML-Validation.jpg)


### Testing User Stories from UX Section

- ### First Time Visitor Goals
 
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily learn the purpose of the site and more about the organisation.

        1. When Entering the site, users are greeted with a vast image with an effect to capture the user's interest.
            This is reinforced with a ethos which states "The Future of Movement Is Here".
        2. This ethos alone captures a user's interest and encourages them to slow down in which they will find more information
            about the company itself as well as the benefits of having a bionic limb.
    
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily navigate through the site to find content.

        1. The website has a clear structure and the header is clearly indicated as to where a link would take you.
            When a user would want to navigate back home, the logo in the header is interactive, thus a link to take you back home
            which is good user experience.
        2. The  website contains a footer with interactive links to choose that will take you to further social sites to learn more about
           the company itself and opens in another tab, leaving the  website in a tab of its own.
    
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to use a form to contact the site for any queries in relation to bionics.


        1. The website has a seperate page labelled as 'Contact Us'. This page has a clear and concise form to interact with.
        2. The form itself is clearly labelled and does not let you submit  unless you fill in all the fields which is good user experience.
    

    ## Further Testing
     - The Website was tested on multiple browsers; Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
     - The Website was viewed on multiple devices, iPhone X/8/7 Plus, Desktop, Laptop, iPad and Huawei P30 Lite.
     - Continuous testing took place to ensure the pages were linked correctly and that images were shown with no marginal errors across the screen.
     - Family members were asked to test the website for me and their stories can be found below;
    
    
    ## Further Testing Stories (Family)
    - "Upon entering the website, the structure was clear and I could make my way around with ease with easily navigational links."

    - "The Gallery page responds well on both mobile and desktop with both margins at the side to ensure the images are centered."

    - "Footer placed well and social links and styling match the theme of the website. The links itself open in a new tab to ensure the website stays open."

    - "Contact page with the form is positioned in a way where the user can clearly view the background image as well as filling in the required details with identifiable labels."


## Known Bugs <a name="knownbugs"></a>

- In mobile view, the navigation bar shows as Home being below the other 2 links. This still functions well.

- In various handheld devices, the gallery page shows images with more margins as usual, the images still show but this does not effect the page as a whole.
